# Plant-Pathology-2020-Competition

Welcome you! This is my implementation of some Machine Learning algorithms for the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) hosted at Kaggle.

The goal of the Competition was simple enough: 
- Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

I was able to achieve the top 8% leaderboard with an Categorization Accuracy of 0.79186, getting the 1532Â° place (of a total of 19395 teams).

Inside the notebook `Titanic.ipynb`, you can find the details about the EDA step and the training step of 5 popular machine learning algorithms: 
- SVM
- Logistic Regressor
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Neural Network using Pytorch
